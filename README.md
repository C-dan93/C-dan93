- 👋 Hi, I’m @C-dan93
- 👀 I’m relatively new to programming but I am willing to learn as much as I can, in the shortest possible time. ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently started a course on R programming and about to complete a Google Data Analytics course. Hope to switch to Python in the nearest future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that requires SQL and R programming skills.
- 📫 You can reach me on cokpara71@gmail.com
